4. Write a function called ``pokemon`` that takes in a list of an integer and string. The integer is the level of the trainer and the string is where the trainer plays. If the player is level five or below, they have the most rattatas. If they are between level 6 and 10, they have the most zubats. If they are higher than level 10, they have the most eevees. Return the string "I'm level __ and I caught a bunch of __ in the __!" where the first blank is the player level, the second is the pokemon, and the third is the location where they play. For instance, if the inputted list is [2, "city"], the returned string should be "I'm level 2 and I caught a bunch of rattatas in the city!" Do this using string interpolation.

4.1 Write a function called ``data_mine`` that takes a tuple as input, and return a string using interpolation, depending on the second item in the tuple. The first item is a city name, the second is the weather condition. If the second item in the tuple has the value of 'rain', then it should also be cloudy. If the second item has the value of 'sun', then there should be blue skies. If the second item has the value of 'snow', then it should be cold. Return the string "In ___ there is ___ so it is ____." or "In ____ there is ___ so there are _____." (so for ('Maz', 'rain'), we would return "In Maz there is rain so it is cloudy" (the same goes for snow), while for ('Bieur', 'sun'), we would return "In Bieur there is sun so there are blue skies.")
